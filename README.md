## How do I approach designing software?

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

After working on this project, I have learned how to create meshes and edit their attributes such as their size, position, color, lighting proporties, and textures. I learned how to use these meshes together and create complex objects using simple shapes. I also learned how to create light and edit its proporties such as its brightness, color, and shading. I even learned how to implement camera controls to lock the mouse to the screen, move around with WASD, move the camera up and down to desired keys, and changing the camera's pov through desired keys.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?

I wanted to create a scene of a moody office desktop work area. This work environment consisted of a notebook, cup holder with pencils, desktop computer, desktop monitor, mouse, and a simple design of a keyboard since I already created complex objects beforehand. I also added a single light blue light to make the scene seem like it's only lightened up from the desktop's computer screen, adding more of a mood-like vibe.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Tactics I've learned from designing could be applied in future work of creating simple models needed for scenes.

## How do I approach developing programs?

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

One new development strategy I used while working on this scene is implementing a similar part of code from the same assignment in the modular and editting it on the project's code to create my desired scene, making it slightly easier than having to create a new one from scratch.

### How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration factored into my development constantly, having to change the size, position, color, light, texture and other attributes to make sure the objects looked just as I had planned.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I liked the approach of learning a new modular and given an assignment first before working on the same topic on the project, it leaves fresh information in my mind and lets me understand what I'm doing with little complications.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Computational graphics and visualizations gave me new knowledge and skills that can be applied by teaching me how to create and edit meshes, light, and textures to create desired models and scenes. This can help whenever a situation calls for a 3D scene or a certain object that is able to be created by different simple shapes. Though, there are different apps such as Blender that can make this process much simpler. Some projects do require the use of CPP instead of being able to manually change them, so it's nice to experience both methods.
